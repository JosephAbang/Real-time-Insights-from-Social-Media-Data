# Real-time Insights from Social Media Data

## Dataset
Twitter provides both global and local trends. I loaded and inspected data for topics that were hot worldwide (WW) and in the United States (US) at the moment of query using JSON response from the call to Twitter's GET trends/place API. After picking a hot topic, using the list of dictionaries, i loaded the data into a dataset. I discovered insights from the data using frequency analysis and plots. 

## Summary of findings
* Lil Dicky's followers reacted the most â€” 42.4% of his followers liked his first tweet.
* Even if celebrities like Katy Perry and Ellen have a huuge Twitter following, their followers hardly reacted, e.g., only 0.0098% of Katy's followers liked her tweet.
* While Leo got the most likes and retweets in terms of counts, his first tweet was only liked by 2.19% of his followers.
* Most of the tweets were in English.
* Polish, Italian and Spanish were the next runner-ups.
* There were a lot of tweets with a language alien to Twitter (lang = 'und').
